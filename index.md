Inspecting Documentation for String Methods
To thoroughly understand and find string methods, consulting the Python documentation is invaluable. Here's how to explore string methods through documentation:

Official Python Documentation: The most authoritative source. Visit the Python documentation for a comprehensive list and explanation of all string methods.

Interactive Help: Use the help() function in Python. Typing help(str) in a Python interpreter will list all the methods available for strings, along with brief descriptions.

Online Resources and Tutorials: Websites like W3Schools, GeeksforGeeks, and Stack Overflow have extensive tutorials and examples on string methods.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Tools: Most modern IDEs like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter notebooks provide inline documentation and auto-completion features that can help you discover and understand string methods as you code.
